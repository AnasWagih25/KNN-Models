# KNN Models on IRIS and WINE Datasets

This repository contains two K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models applied to the IRIS and WINE datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of these models is to classify the data points based on features using the KNN algorithm and evaluate their performance.

## Datasets

1. **IRIS Dataset**
   - The IRIS dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

2. **WINE Dataset**
   - The WINE dataset contains 178 samples of wine, each with 13 chemical properties. The goal is to classify the wines into one of three classes based on these chemical properties.
